Day2.js

----slice---
// slice-->> used to create a copy of a portion of the Array. it dosen't modify original
// Array.
// slice(startindex,endindex) where startindex inclusive and endindex is exclusive.


-----splice---

it is used to change the content of an array by removing or replacing existing and 
adding new elements.
//splice(startIndex, deleteCount,item)


----split---
its works on string
Split a string into substrings using the specified separator and return them as an array.

@param separator — A string that identifies character or characters to use in separating the string. If omitted, a single-element array containing the entire string is returned.
@param limit — A value used to limit the number of elements returned in the array.



----object----
important method used in object

object.keys(object_name)//it helps to find the keys present on object
object.values(object_name)//it helps to find the vluse present on object
object.freez(object_name)//it helps to prevent the modify of object data form outside..

---condition---
if(condition is true){
    excute this
}
else{
    if fales excute else part
}
to replace this we can use ternary operator
variable = condition ? expression1 ( if condition is true) : Expression2(if condition is false)






day3----

-----function----
in short if someone says add 1+1 ..
but that person says add add again this numberr as he want for repeated time
 to slove such repeated approach in coding .. function is pice of code written to overcome
 repetition and more..
 maintainable
 eg console.log(1+1)
 console.log(1+2)
